# machinelearning
ML is the subset of AI that enables system to learn automatically from the data by analysis on the basis of pre defined algo which help to predict and make improve pattern of data for desired outcome without explicilty using the coding structure . It involves training algo on data to identfiy patterns , relationships and decision mahing processess.
Key components of ML
1 . Data
2 . Algo
3. Model Training
4. Prediction and decision making

Type of ML
1. Supervised Learning -> work on lablled data
2. Unsupervised Learning -> identify and orgainse unstructureed data into labled form 
3. Reinforement Learning -> Learning through trials and error so system work on env.

Goals of ML
1. Predicition
2. Classification
3. Clustering
4. Decision making
5. Optimization

Mathematical statistics for ML(basic level)
1. Mean - average value
2. Median - mid value after organizing data in asending order
3. Mode - most common value
4. Standard Devition - is the numver that describe the how value spread out from median value
